## Tragedy & Grace
> <div class=noindent>Solomon, bright as morning sun,<br/>
> a crown heavier than gold,<br/>
> wisdom poured like water<br/>
> into vessels of endless thirst.<br/>
> He spoke of cedars, hyssop,<br/>
> and the secret songs of birds,<br/>
> boundless as sand,<br/>
> greater than kings.<br/><br/>
> A temple rose at his command,<br/>
> stone and cedar, prayer and glory,<br/>
> a dwelling built for God—<br/>
> but could not hold the builder's heart.<br/><br/>
> In love multiplied, his wisdom stumbled;<br/>
> the splendor fractured in shadows cast<br/>
> by altars raised to lesser gods.<br/>
> Seven hundred queens,<br/>
> thousands of whispered promises,<br/>
> and the quiet slipping of his soul.<br/><br/>
> Yet greatness lingered,<br/>
> undiminished but stained,<br/>
> a king's sorrow woven through gold.<br/>
> The throne remained,<br/>
> but the kingdom tore like fabric,<br/>
> and Israel bore the weight<br/>
> of a heart turned away.<br/><br/>
> But in tragedy echoes hope:<br/>
> though Solomon fell, God's love did not.<br/>
> For it is not in wisdom,<br/>
> nor riches nor mighty deeds,<br/>
> but in mercy given freely,<br/>
> that a king is redeemed.<br/><br/>
> Solomon, grandeur mingled with grief,<br/>
> human and holy intertwined,<br/>
> God loved you still—<br/>
> and that is what remains.

## A Reflection
The life of Solomon resonates with us because it encapsulates the profound paradox of human existence—greatness shadowed by frailty. His extraordinary wisdom, divinely bestowed and unmatched, exemplified humanity's highest potential. Solomon spoke eloquently of nature's wonders, resolved intricate dilemmas, and presided over an era of unparalleled peace and prosperity. Yet, this exceptional wisdom and splendor could not shield him from human vulnerability.

Solomon’s tragedy, in the classical sense, lies precisely in his fall from grace despite abundant gifts. It was not ignorance that led him astray, but the subtle seductions of the heart—multiplied loves that fractured devotion. His numerous foreign wives introduced competing loyalties, corrupting purity with divided worship. Solomon’s spiritual disintegration repeats the familiar human story: possessing great knowledge does not ensure perfect choices. Wisdom without disciplined devotion can falter, and so Israel suffered.

Yet, Solomon’s fall does not erase his greatness; rather, it sharpens our awareness of the delicate balance between divine favor and human responsibility. He built the Temple, symbolizing profound devotion, yet his heart drifted toward idols. The kingdom’s subsequent division, a result of his actions, underscores the ripple effect of personal decisions, demonstrating how leadership inevitably shapes communal destiny.

Nevertheless, Solomon’s story is ultimately redemptive. God's persistent love transcends Solomon’s failures. His mistakes were immense, his regrets profound, yet God's mercy remained constant. This enduring mercy offers hope to all who recognize their shortcomings. Solomon’s narrative teaches humility: even the wisest among us can falter, but divine compassion prevails.

In the end, Solomon is remembered not merely as a wise king whose greatness was marred by tragedy, but as one profoundly loved by God. His story mirrors our own humanity—marked by triumph and defeat, strength and vulnerability. God's unwavering love amid human fragility becomes the true legacy of Solomon. This, above all else, is the enduring truth: we are loved despite our flaws, and that love is our ultimate redemption.
