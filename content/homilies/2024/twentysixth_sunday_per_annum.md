It is hard to picture this Gospel scene. The world has changed dramatically over the last 2,000 years. We do not often witness exorcisms today, and we certainly do not see them happening on the streets. In Jesus’ time, however, exorcisms were not sensationalized by the media or turned into the plots of low-brow movies. They were a regular part of life. Demons were believed to be the cause of bad luck, illness, and psychological disturbance. As a result, exorcists were common, even performing their rituals in public. Walking through the streets of the ancient world, you might see people visiting a local exorcist, having prayers said over them. Some of these exorcists were frauds, taking advantage of the people’s ignorance and stealing their money. Others were sincere believers who sought to bring God’s grace and healing to a world in need.


One day, as the apostles were walking, they encountered such a scene, and they were scandalized. They saw a stranger casting out demons in the name of Jesus. Naturally, they tried to stop him. This person was not part of their group; he was not one of Jesus’ followers, so how could he know who Jesus truly was? How could he use the sacred name without understanding its full meaning? The apostles were confident they had done the right thing and went to Jesus to tell him what they had done, proud of themselves for protecting his name and reputation from impostors. But to their surprise, Jesus rebuked them. He told them to leave the man alone, for at least he was speaking well of him. The same Jesus who at other times seemed concerned with people recognizing him as the Messiah and Son of God was now advocating for a radical tolerance toward outsiders. He said, “Whoever is not against me is for me.” The measure of being “for” or “against” Jesus wasn’t perfect understanding or deep theological knowledge—it was how his name was used. Those who invoked the name of Jesus as a blessing would themselves be blessed because, by their actions, they were recognizing him as a source of goodness. But those who used his name as a curse would be cursed, for in doing so, they attributed evil to him and distanced themselves from his goodness.


Here, in this place, we frequently invoke the name of Jesus. We use his name to transform ordinary water into the wellspring of eternal life, cleansing us from original sin and uniting us to the mystical body of Christ. We call upon his name to transform bread and wine into divine, life-sustaining food, into God himself. We use his name in confession to forgive sins, in marriage to unite a couple for life, and in the anointing of the sick to bring comfort and healing. In this place, the name of Jesus is a blessing.


But what about in our homes and in our hearts? When we stub our toe, do we shout, “Jesus Christ,” not as a prayer but as a curse, directing our frustration at the table leg, the situation, and ultimately at God himself? Do we use his name casually, sprinkling it into conversation without reverence, to express annoyance or dissatisfaction over minor inconveniences? Have we turned his name into a curse? We may argue that this is just a habit or a part of our culture, but Jesus reminds us that our words and actions are rooted in our hearts.


Those who use the name of Jesus as a blessing believe he is a blessing; those who use his name as a curse see him as a burden. Jesus offers us boundless love and a new way of life, filled with mercy. The least we can do is speak well of him, not only in this place, but in our homes and in the presence of everyone we meet.
