On this First Sunday of Advent, we hear Jesus’ apocalyptic words in the gospel: descriptions of cosmic signs, nations in dismay, and people overcome with fear. At first glance, these words might tempt us to despair, as they mirror the anxieties we often feel when we look at our world today. Natural disasters, political unrest, and personal struggles can leave us feeling as if everything is unraveling. But Jesus does not speak to sow fear; he speaks to give us hope.


Advent is a season of anticipation. While we prepare to celebrate the birth of Christ at Christmas, this gospel reminds us that we are also waiting for his glorious return. Jesus tells us to “stand erect and raise your heads because your redemption is at hand.” These are not words of doom but of profound hope. They invite us to lift our eyes above the chaos of the moment and trust that God is in control.


The reality is, bad things will happen. Jesus does not promise a life free from suffering or a world without turmoil. But he does promise that he is coming to make all things right. In him, history is not aimless but moving toward a definitive conclusion: the triumph of God’s love. The cosmic upheaval he describes is not destruction for destruction’s sake; it is the labor pains of a new creation, a world restored to perfect harmony.


Knowing this changes everything. If God holds history in his hands, we don’t have to live in fear. We don’t have to be consumed by the anxieties of the present moment. Yes, the world is imperfect. Yes, we face challenges that can seem overwhelming. But none of this is the end of the story. Jesus will return, and we who remain faithful will be raised with him to eternal life, where every tear will be wiped away, and every sorrow will be transformed into joy.


This assurance calls us to a specific way of living. Jesus warns us not to let our hearts become “drowsy” with distractions, whether from indulgence or the burdens of daily life. Advent is a time to refocus, to be vigilant in prayer, and to fix our hearts on the hope of Christ. It is not a season of idle waiting but of active preparation, a time to align our lives with the promise of his return.


So, as we begin this holy season, do not be afraid. Do not let the troubles of the world weigh you down. Instead, raise your head and rejoice, for God is near. Let this Advent be a time to deepen your trust in the one who is coming to redeem the world. Even in the midst of life’s trials, we are called to live as people of hope, knowing that the God who came to us in a manger will come again in glory. And when he does, all will be made new.
