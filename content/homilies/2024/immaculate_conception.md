Today, we celebrate God’s infinite mercy. While we often think of this feast as a celebration of Mary, at its heart, it is a celebration of God’s boundless love and generosity toward humanity. The Immaculate Conception refers to the singular grace bestowed upon Mary: her being conceived without the stain of Original Sin. From the very first moment of her existence, Mary was free from the guilt and darkness that affect each of us.


What makes this gift so remarkable is that it was given to Mary at her conception, long before she ever made a choice or said “yes” to God. This grace was not something Mary earned; it was a completely free and undeserved gift of God. He did not have to give her this privilege, nor did he have to call her to her extraordinary vocation. Yet, out of his great love, he chose to do so. God knew the plans he had for her—to become the Mother of his Son—and in his mercy, he lavished her with this unique grace, preparing her for her role in salvation history.


This feast reminds us of the depths of God’s love. Seeing the brokenness of humanity, consumed by sin and separated from him, God was moved with compassion. In his mercy, he poured out his grace upon Mary, freeing her from our plight and strengthening her to say “yes” to becoming the Mother of God. Through her “yes,” she gave birth to Jesus, the source of our salvation.


But God’s mercy does not stop with Mary. The same abundant love that God showed to her is extended to each of us. Despite our sins and failures, God does not abandon us. Instead, he continually reaches out, drawing us back into relationship with him. His mercy is always available, waiting for us to open our hearts to it.


What does God ask of us in return? He asks us to let go of the things that bind us: our sins, our attachments, and our self-centered desires. He calls us to choose him above all else and to recognize that his love and mercy are worth more than anything this world can offer.


When we open our hearts to God in this way, we find true happiness—the kind of happiness Mary experienced during her life and now enjoys forever in heaven. Today’s feast reminds us that God’s mercy is endless and his love for us is unconditional. May we, like Mary, respond with trust and surrender, allowing his grace to transform our lives.
