Often, we are afraid to be Christians, to take the words of Jesus literally and follow him. His demands are not small—he demands everything. We are called to love our enemies, take up our cross, and become the servant of all. This can be a daunting and even frightening task. Following Jesus authentically means letting go of not only our possessions but, perhaps more challengingly, our egos. We fear that living as Christ teaches might leave us vulnerable. We worry that others will take advantage of our mercy and compassion, that we will be misunderstood or even abandoned by those closest to us. And yes, we know that we will suffer.


These fears are understandable because everything we fear happened to Jesus. He became the servant of all, and in his final moments, he was abandoned by almost everyone. Yet to stop there—to dwell only on his suffering and abandonment—misses the deeper truth, the ultimate victory.


Death did not have the final word. Christ was not defeated. He rose again, triumphing over sin and death. When he returned from the grave, he was transformed, revealing to us what his new kingdom truly looks like. In the Incarnation, God emptied himself of his infinite power and glory, taking on human weakness. To the world, it seemed he had given up everything—becoming poor, weak, and a servant to all. But in that very act of humility, he gained the one thing he desired: us. He healed the broken, comforted the sorrowful, and gave hope to the poor and suffering. Through his sacrifice, he destroyed sin and death—the only things that could separate us from him—and gave us new and everlasting life.


When God became the least and the servant of all, he lost nothing; instead, he gained everything.


Therefore, we have nothing to fear. God gave up his eternal glory to win his deepest desire, our love and friendship. And he promises to do the same for us. Whatever we lose in this life will be restored—whether in this world or in the next. No sacrifice we make will go unrewarded. So, do not be afraid when you must humble yourself or serve even those who mistreat you. Such suffering is temporary. On the last day, Christ will raise the lowly to eternal life and infinite joy, while the mighty and proud will be cast down. His kingdom, a kingdom of mercy and service, will reign forever.


“For the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
