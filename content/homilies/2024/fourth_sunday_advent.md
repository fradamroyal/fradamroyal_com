“Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled.” These words from Elizabeth to Mary in today’s Gospel shine as a beacon of hope and faith. They remind us that trust in God’s promises is the foundation of true blessing, even when the path seems uncertain or fraught with difficulty.

This trust, however, is not easy. It was not easy for Mary, the Blessed Virgin. We often view the world of Jesus through the lens of his encounters with the Pharisees, Scribes, and political leaders—debates over doctrine and Scripture. Yet, this perspective can obscure the profound reality of God’s transformative action in human history.

Mary lived in a time of upheaval and loss. The identity of Israel had long been shaped by the twelve tribes—the descendants of Jacob’s sons—who were freed from slavery in Egypt, given the Promised Land, and united under a king from David’s line. At the heart of their worship stood the Temple in Jerusalem, the sole place of sacrifice to the God of Israel. This was Israel’s identity, the essence of who they were.

But by Mary’s time, that identity had been shattered. The tribes divided after Solomon’s reign, and ten were lost forever when exiled by foreign powers. The remaining two tribes suffered exile as well, and although they returned and rebuilt the Temple, it too faced desecration. Foreign invaders, notably the Seleucids, defiled the sacred space, outlawed the Law of Moses, and abolished the Davidic kingship. Even the priesthood, meant to descend from the lineage of Zadok, had been usurped.

What was left of Israel? Their defining markers—tribes, Temple, kingship, and priesthood—were gone or corrupted. Despair took hold. Many believed God had abandoned them, and they looked to human leaders—the Pharisees, Scribes, and self-proclaimed kings—to fill the void.

Yet, amid this despair, Mary of Nazareth dared to hope. She placed her trust not in human solutions but in the God of Israel. She believed that he who promised would fulfill his word. And in her faith, she became the vessel through which God brought the ultimate fulfillment of his promises.

Jesus was born. God became man. And humanity received a gift beyond comprehension. Jesus did not merely restore what was lost; he fulfilled and surpassed it. Where Israel had hoped for worldly peace, Jesus offered eternal joy. Where they sought an earthly kingdom, he opened the gates of the heavenly one.

In Jesus, the scattered were gathered. The lost tribes were found—not just within Israel but among the nations, united into one family of God. The Temple was rebuilt, not in stone but in the body of Christ, and expanded into every believer. The kingship was restored, as a descendant of David now reigns eternally. And the priesthood was made perfect, renewed in the eternal priesthood of Melchizedek.

Every marker of Israel’s identity that seemed irretrievably lost was returned—greater, unshakable, and eternal. Through Christ, the impossible became reality. The crippled walked, the blind saw, sins were forgiven, and wounds were healed. When the infinite God became finite, he transformed the universe and revealed that nothing is beyond his power.

This truth is our hope. There is no pain, no loss, no situation so dire that God cannot redeem it. Mary of Nazareth knew this, and her faith enabled her to say, “Let it be done to me according to your word.”

Like Mary, we are called to trust in God, especially in moments of great difficulty. Our parish faces challenges that strike at the heart of our identity and unity. It may feel as though something central to who we are is slipping away. Yet, just as God restored and transformed Israel, he will restore and transform us.

We are not alone. Christ is with us. He is the Good Shepherd who seeks out the lost, the King who reigns with justice and love, the High Priest who intercedes for us. He has never abandoned his people, and he will not abandon us now.

But we must respond as Mary did. We must open our hearts to God’s grace, trusting that his promises will be fulfilled in ways we cannot yet imagine. Let us bring him our sadness, our anger, our fear, and our pain. Let us surrender these burdens to the only one who can heal and restore.

God is faithful. He has accomplished the impossible in every age, and he will do so again for us. This Advent, as we prepare to celebrate the coming of Christ, let us embrace the hope and joy of his presence. Let us believe, as Mary did, that what the Lord has spoken will be fulfilled.

Through him, our brokenness can become wholeness. Our despair can turn to joy. Our parish can emerge stronger, renewed in faith, and united in his love. Trust in him, for he is Emmanuel—God with us—and he will never fail us.
