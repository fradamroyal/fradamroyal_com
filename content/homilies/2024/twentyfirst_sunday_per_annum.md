This gospel is a sorrowful reflection on humanity's response to Jesus' offer of himself. While his Eucharistic speech may seem like just one teaching that is being rejected, it is actually a culmination of all his teachings, a summary of the entirety of his message. When many of his disciples walk away, they are not merely rejecting this single idea, but rather abandoning everything Jesus has taught them.


It is natural to wonder why they would make such a choice. Jesus' teachings are centered on love, sacrifice, forgiveness, and mercy - ideals that seem universally desirable. Who wouldn't want to live in a world where everyone loves and cares for one another? Yet, as we look around us, it becomes clear that many people prioritize greed and selfishness over the well-being of others.


Upon reflection, we may see similar patterns in our own lives. How often do we put our own interests ahead of the needs of those around us? We may not even realize the harm caused by our actions. This rejection of Jesus' teachings is not just a problem for others; it's a fundamental flaw within ourselves.


Ultimately, God presents us with two distinct paths: one leading to paradise and the other to chaos. We can choose a world governed by love, where the poor are blessed and mercy prevails, or we can succumb to the law of pride, which isolates us from each other and fuels hatred. This is the fundamental choice Jesus presents to us.


It's perplexing that so many people seem to opt for chaos. Why do they choose evil when goodness is available? The truth is, there is no logical explanation for this choice. Evil is not a thing in itself; it's merely the absence of good. Goodness is what truly exists, as it is a participation in God.


When we see others making choices that seem evil, it is essential to remember that people are not inherently evil. Every person is fundamentally good, as their existence is a manifestation of God's goodness. However, they are incomplete, lacking the fullness of life that God offers. This is why Jesus gives himself in the Eucharist - to fill the void within us.


The Eucharist is our remedy, bringing wholeness to our souls. It is the culmination of all Jesus' teachings, a reminder that he wants to complete what is missing in us. As we receive him, let us remember his invitation: "Take, and eat," and know the fullness of life in God.
