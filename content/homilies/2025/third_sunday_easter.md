There is a saying we have all heard countless times: "God never gives us more than we can handle." While it might sound comforting, it is simply not true. Life’s experiences teach us otherwise. Think of the parent who loses a child, the person diagnosed with a terminal illness, or someone facing the shock of unemployment. In these moments, the burdens are undeniably overwhelming, stretching human strength far beyond its limits.

The apostles knew this reality intimately. They had devoted their lives to Jesus, following him, learning from him, witnessing miracles and profound truths. Yet, when confronted with the unbearable weight of the cross, even they faltered. The crucifixion was too much; fear overcame faith, and they scattered, returning to their old ways. Peter went back to fishing, perhaps hoping that routine would ease his pain and guilt. His friends joined him, their hearts equally heavy with uncertainty.

Yet precisely in their moment of retreat, Jesus sought them out. He did not chastise them or rebuke them; he understood their fragility. Seeing their empty nets after a fruitless night, he gently instructed, "Cast the net over the right side of the boat and you will find something." His words carried more than fishing advice; they offered renewed hope. And indeed, the nets filled abundantly, revealing the Lord's presence even in failure, even when their strength had failed.

Here is the truth: God does indeed allow burdens too great for us alone, but he never leaves us to carry them by ourselves. He transforms our moments of defeat and doubt into opportunities for grace. Jesus did not just stand on the shore giving advice; he called the disciples to share a meal. Over breakfast on that quiet shore, the Lord reaffirmed his presence and renewed their strength.

The grace of God is not confined to miracles on distant shores. Christ’s presence is among us today, embodied in each of us through baptism and the Eucharist. We become his hands, his voice, and his compassion. Our calling is clear—to carry one another’s burdens, just as he carries ours.

When we comfort those who are grieving, we are Christ’s gentle voice. When we sit quietly with the sick, we embody his loving presence. When we feed the hungry and shelter the homeless, we live the Gospel in tangible ways. This is our mission—to remind the suffering world that it is not alone. We do not merely speak of hope; we enact it through love, empathy, and solidarity.

We may indeed face more than we can handle alone, but this does not signal God's abandonment. Rather, it calls us deeper into community, deeper into compassion. Each act of kindness, each sacrifice of our time, is God's grace in action. Just as Jesus appeared on the shore to strengthen his disciples, he continues to appear through us, transforming despair into hope.

Let us embrace this wonderful responsibility, recognizing that through us, Christ remains active and visible in the world. When burdens overwhelm, remember that God's grace is abundant and near. Together, in love and faith, we carry each other forward, confident that Christ journeys with us every step of the way.
