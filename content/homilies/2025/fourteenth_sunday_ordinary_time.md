“Peace to this household.” With these simple yet powerful words, Jesus teaches us precisely how we are to approach others. Notice that the first step of evangelization, the first moment of witnessing to Christ, is not a catechism quiz or a doctrinal declaration; it is an offer of peace, an opening of the heart. Peace prepares us for genuine communion. It allows us to sit down together at one table, to share a meal, and, in doing so, to encounter Christ himself.

When Jesus sends out the seventy-two, he sends them into the complexities and uncertainties of the world, “like lambs among wolves.” He sends them empty-handed, with no distractions, no material possessions. But he gives them one extraordinary treasure, a treasure far richer than money or goods: his peace. This peace is the key that opens doors, the essential ingredient for authentic human connection. This peace, flowing from Christ’s own heart, invites the stranger, welcomes the outsider, and bridges divisions.

In the mass, we experience this truth. Think about the moment after the consecration. Christ has become truly present on our altar. We kneel in reverence and adoration, awe-struck by this great mystery. But then, surprisingly, we rise. We turn to one another, extending not casual greetings but a sacred sign, saying, “Peace be with you.” This moment is not a pause or an interruption; it is integral to the Eucharist. Before we can share the Body and Blood of Christ, before we can enter into the deepest communion with God himself, we must share peace with each other. We must open our hearts, forgive past grievances, and let go of bitterness. Only then can we partake in the sacred meal Christ offers.

Imagine if we truly lived this peace beyond these walls—if we took this sacred peace out into our everyday interactions. What might happen if every encounter with a neighbor, coworker, stranger, or even adversary began with a sincere offering of peace? Peace is powerful precisely because it does not demand prior agreement, shared culture, or common backgrounds. It asks only for openness, only for the willingness to recognize Christ’s presence in one another. When we offer peace sincerely, barriers soften, hearts open, and relationships flourish.

This is why our Lord instructs us, above all else, to lead with peace. It is peace that makes it possible to sit together, to share God’s bounty, and ultimately to experience Christ himself in our midst. The peace we offer is not our own; it is Christ’s peace, a peace stronger than hatred, deeper than division, more healing than any hurt.

As mass concludes today, we will again hear those final words: “Go in peace.” These words are not simply a dismissal; they are a divine commission. Christ sends us out as apostles, carriers of his profound peace. We may encounter acceptance or rejection, openness or indifference, yet our call remains unchanged: offer peace. For in this offering, the Kingdom of God draws near, hearts awaken, and we become true messengers of the Good News—messengers who heal, reconcile, and gather all peoples into the loving embrace of Christ.
