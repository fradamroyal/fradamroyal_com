Jesus rides into Jerusalem today not as a conquering king but as the one who willingly goes to the cross. Every step, every gesture of his procession speaks clearly of one thing: the limitless depth of God’s love for us. Yet how often do we doubt this love, feeling isolated by pain, misunderstood by others, or burdened by hidden wounds?

Today, we see Jesus embracing our pain, carrying it deliberately toward the cross. His entry into Jerusalem is more than just a historical event—it is God’s profound declaration that we will never be alone. Our suffering, which we believe isolates us, actually draws us intimately into Christ’s own journey. He makes our loneliness his own; he enters our abandonment, our rejection, our fears, and insecurities.

When Jesus tells the Pharisees, “I tell you, if they keep silent, the stones will cry out!” he assures us that this truth—his boundless compassion—is unstoppable. Even creation itself proclaims God’s response to human isolation and pain: you are not forgotten, you are deeply cherished.

Each of us carries burdens that can make us feel distant or unloved, yet the cross stands as the ultimate answer to our heart’s greatest longing. Jesus does not merely understand our suffering from afar; he feels it deeply in his own flesh, and by his wounds, we find healing.

Look today upon Christ crucified, the definitive proof that you are never alone, never abandoned. There is no depth of pain he has not known, no darkness he cannot illuminate. He loves you this much—enough to give everything for you.
