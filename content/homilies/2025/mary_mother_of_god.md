The Blessed Virgin Mary is the supreme model for the Church and for every believer. Yet, it is unfortunate that we so often misunderstand and mischaracterize her. For far too long, Mary has been seen as merely demure and maidenly, a passive vessel who carried God rather than an active participant in the drama of salvation.

But that is not the Mary of Nazareth we encounter in scripture. A passive vessel is not the young woman who said “yes” to God. The Mary of the Gospels is the Mother of God, the model of Christian faith, and the greatest of Jesus’ disciples. God did not love her and bestow his abundant grace upon her because she was quiet and submissive. He chose her as his very mother because she was courageous. When faced with an incomprehensible mystery, she said “yes.” Contrast this with the many men in scripture who hesitated or tried to avoid God’s call. Elijah hid his face. Jeremiah said, “I am too young.” Moses said, “I think you are looking for my brother.” But Mary stared directly into the heart of the mystery, and with courage and faith, she said “yes.” Yes, she would give birth to the world’s salvation. Yes, she would stand by the cross and watch her only child die so that we all might live.

When the Blessed Virgin heard the word of God, the Gospel says she “treasured” it and “reflected” or “pondered” on it. That word, “reflected,” is the same word St. Luke later uses to mean “to wage war.” {{< sidenote >}} Gk. συμβάλλω {{< /sidenote >}} Mary’s acceptance of the word of God, her response of faith, was not blind or passive obedience. It was a living, active, and ferocious faith. Like her ancestor Jacob, the great patriarch, she wrestled with God in her heart. And like Jacob, she prevailed. When Jacob won his wrestling match with God, he was blessed, renamed Israel, and became the father of the Jewish people. When Mary “waged war” with the word of God in her heart, God blessed her, making her the Mother of the Church, the Mother of a new creation, and the Mother of all humanity renewed in Christ.

Like Mary, God calls each of us to a journey filled with uncertainties and challenges. Questioning or doubting his call—even wrestling with God—is not sinful. What is sinful is giving up. God desires a mature relationship with us, one where we engage with his word, wrestle with it, and respond in faith. We are not mindless automatons, and we must not act as if we are.

The Church begins the new year with this feast of Mary, Mother of God, because she is the ultimate example of the Christian life. As this year begins, let us resolve to imitate her. Let us treasure the word of God in our hearts, wrestle with it until we receive his blessing, and trust that no matter what obstacles we face, God will walk with us and lead us through.
