I have always found the structure of this parable striking. At first glance, the details seem to emphasize the contrast between wealth and poverty and our obligation to care for the poor. Perhaps they even hint at the reality of hell. Yet, by the time we reach the conclusion, it becomes clear that the true focus is on listening to the word of God. That is the heart of the parable: the call to hear and respond to God's word, for it is in listening that true transformation occurs.

I sometimes wonder if the structure itself is meant to remind us of how easily we become distracted. We latch onto secondary details, thinking the lesson is about one thing or another, when the answer has been before us all along: listen to the word of God. Whatever struggles we face, the path to change is the same—through hearing God's word, through deepening our relationship with him. It is in this encounter that we receive the conviction and grace necessary for transformation.

Not everyone wrestles with the disparity between wealth and poverty, but all of us struggle with something. Every person is called to ongoing conversion, to be drawn ever closer to Christ and to reflect him more fully. And the only way to achieve this is by immersing ourselves in his word—by truly listening, allowing him to speak to our hearts and reshape us.

This is especially important during Lent. It is easy to focus on external practices—ensuring we follow the rules, keeping our chosen penances—but just as easy to reach the end of the season unchanged. We may have checked every box, yet failed to let these practices penetrate our hearts. If we do not listen to God in these moments, we risk missing the very grace he offers us through them.

So let us be attentive. Let us listen with sincerity and openness, refusing to be distracted by peripheral concerns. May we allow God's word to work within us as it is meant to, shaping our souls and drawing us ever closer to him.
