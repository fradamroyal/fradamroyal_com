Tonight we witness something unexpected: the Lord, the master, the teacher, kneeling at the feet of his disciples. Amidst the echoes of Passover preparations, amidst talk of betrayal and sacrifice, one action pierces through: Jesus washing feet. It might seem odd that on Holy Thursday, the night we celebrate the instituion of the Eucharist, we are given a Gospel that does not explicitly show the Eucharist at all. Instead, we encounter humility in its purest form.

But we have been here before. We have witnessed this scene of feet being tended to once already. Recall Mary, the sister of Lazarus, pouring costly perfume on the feet of Jesus. The disciples watched, bewildered. Judas grumbled at the wastefulness. But Mary understood. She recognized precisely where to find Jesus—not in busyness or grand celebration, but in the extravagance of humble service. Mary knew something the others did not yet grasp: Jesus would always be found at the feet of another, in gestures of profound love and service.

This evening, we learn once more where to encounter Jesus. Not simply in the breaking of bread—though he is truly present there—but also in washing feet. Jesus tells Peter, "Unless I wash you, you will have no inheritance with me." This inheritance is not wealth or power; it is participation in Christ's humble, life-giving service.

Jesus' command to his disciples, and to us, is clear: as he served, so must we. The Eucharist we celebrate tonight points beyond the table toward lives poured out for others. It challenges us to recognize Christ not merely on the altar, but in the faces of those we serve—the poor, the imprisoned, the hurting, and the excluded. This is where the Eucharist truly unfolds, where Christ himself takes flesh and blood in acts of compassion, forgiveness, and selfless love.

When we lose sight of Jesus, when faith feels distant or abstract, it is often because we have forgotten this simple truth. Christ does not dwell in abstract pieties or busyness; Christ dwells in the humble and concrete acts of service that stretch us beyond comfort, beyond convenience.

Tonight, Jesus offers a living example. He places before us the simplicity of water, towel, and humility. His message is unequivocal: true communion with Christ is inseparable from loving service to one another. Every act of humble care brings the reality of the Eucharist vividly alive.

As we continue this mass of the Lord's Supper, let us hold fast to its profound invitation. May our lives echo Mary's extravagant love, poured out freely, recognizing that wherever humble service happens, Christ is truly among us.
