“Why are you standing there looking at the sky?” With these words, the angels confronted the disciples in their moment of uncertainty and hesitation. It was a question that pierced their confusion and moved them from paralysis toward purpose. Jesus had departed, leaving them behind, and their gaze was locked heavenward, lost in wonder and in apprehension. They had depended upon Jesus—his presence, his wisdom, his reassuring voice. Now they stood frozen, caught in the unknown.

Like the disciples, we often find ourselves staring into the sky of our own uncertainties. Times come when familiar anchors vanish, leaving us feeling vulnerable, wondering, “Now what?” We know these moments well—when life takes sudden turns, when comforts fade, or when responsibilities feel too great. Our inclination, like theirs, is often to stand still, waiting for clarity to descend.

Yet the angels’ challenge was an invitation, not a rebuke. It urged the disciples—and it urges us—to turn from passive waiting to active trust, from bewilderment to prayerful engagement. Jesus had prepared them precisely for this moment. His departure was not abandonment; rather, it was a necessary step for their growth, the opening of a pathway to embrace their true calling. Jesus had promised them the Holy Spirit, assuring them, “you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.” His departure made space for them to become witnesses, ambassadors of mercy and love to every corner of the world.

The disciples’ response is instructive. They returned to the upper room—the sacred site of the last supper, the washing of the feet—and they immersed themselves in prayer. This was not idle retreat; it was preparation. Through prayer, clarity emerged. The Holy Spirit unveiled the next steps: the empty seat of Judas was filled by Matthias, and their mission crystallized. Only then, propelled by the Spirit, did the Church begin its true work—reaching outward, beyond familiar walls, embodying Christ’s love and mercy for all to encounter.

Our lives mirror this story. Here we are, gathered as the Church, remembering Christ’s words, sharing in his Body and Blood, and embracing community. Yet, as we know, merely attending, merely remembering, is insufficient. Judas himself did these things and yet remained distant from genuine discipleship. The mark of our true identity as Christians lies in our willingness to step beyond ritual into active witness. Our gatherings, our prayers, our Eucharist—they must propel us outward, to offer the mercy we ourselves have received.

This is our sacred calling: not to stand still, gazing upward in uncertainty, but to allow our hearts to be transformed and to carry forth Christ’s compassion into the world. It is precisely because Jesus ascended that we now embody his mission on earth. We are his witnesses—entrusted, equipped, and sent.

As we go forth today, let us move forward with renewed resolve, leaving behind our fears and embracing the dynamic, outward movement of our faith. Let us stop staring at the sky and begin living the gospel we celebrate. This is how we truly become the Church, bearing witness to Christ’s love until he comes again.
