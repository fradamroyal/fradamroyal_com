We find ourselves on a mountaintop, standing in the presence of something extraordinary. In that moment, the veil between heaven and earth is pulled back just enough for us to see the world as God intended—a world radiant with divine light, untouched by sin and sorrow.

At first, this revelation might seem disconnected from the journey of Lent. Why, in the midst of a season focused on penance and fasting, do we pause to gaze upon Christ in glory? Why, as we walk through this time of spiritual struggle, does the Church set before us this dazzling, almost otherworldly scene? It can feel like a cruel reminder of what we are not yet able to reach.

But the Transfiguration is not meant to mock us. It is not a distraction or a detour from the Lenten path. Rather, it is a signpost that illuminates our journey’s true purpose. Lent, at its heart, is not about suffering for its own sake. It is not about giving things up just to prove our discipline. Instead, it is about reorienting our lives toward the world that Christ reveals on the mountain—a world bathed in God’s glory, a world where all creation is as it was meant to be.

The fasting, the penance, the almsgiving—these are not ends in themselves. They are tools to help us shed the distortions and shadows of sin that cloud our vision. When we relinquish the distractions of wealth, comfort, and self-indulgence, we begin to see more clearly by the light of Christ. Lent invites us to let go of the imperfect and to fix our eyes on the perfect. It is a time to experience conversion of the heart, to embrace the new law of love that Jesus shows us, and to journey toward the paradise that the Father offers.

Peter’s reaction on the mountain—his desire to stay, to build shelters and remain in that luminous moment—resonates with all of us. We long for the peace and joy of that perfect world. Yet the voice from the cloud reminds us: “This is my chosen Son; listen to him.” The call is not to remain on the mountaintop, but to follow Jesus down the path of his mission, to listen to his words, and to live as he lived. By doing so, we are not leaving behind the glory we glimpse. Instead, we are carrying that light into the darkness of our daily lives, so that we can be transformed and help transform the world around us.

This is the invitation of Lent: to see beyond the sacrifices and disciplines, to recognize their purpose in preparing our hearts for the joy of the resurrection. It is a season of hope, a time of looking beyond the present struggles to the glory that awaits. In the light of the Transfiguration, we find the strength to press on, knowing that the path of Lent leads not to sorrow, but to the joy of living fully in God’s love.
