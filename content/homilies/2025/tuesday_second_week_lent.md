The Lord reminds us that we are not to take on exalted titles like “rabbi.” However, in our modern society, titles no longer carry the same weight they did in Jesus’ time. There are few positions left that command such honor universally, so we do not struggle with this issue in the same way. What remains unchanged, however, is the human tendency to place heavy burdens on others while excusing ourselves. This is the deeper concern Jesus addresses, and it is just as relevant today as it was then.

How often do we find ourselves judging others harshly while letting ourselves off the hook? If someone else falls short, we may think, “How could they do that?” But when we stumble in a similar way, we quickly rationalize it: “I had good reasons; it was different for me.” This tendency to impose heavy demands on others while excusing our own faults is part of our human nature. Yet Jesus calls us to turn this attitude upside down.

As Christians, we are to be stricter with ourselves and more lenient with others. This means holding ourselves accountable, following the Lord’s commandments without making excuses, and not seeking to justify our shortcomings. At the same time, we should approach others with understanding and compassion. When we see their struggles, we might say, “Given their circumstances, it makes sense why they’re struggling in this way. I can see why they might need a lighter burden.” In this way, we reflect the mercy of the Father: strict with ourselves, merciful to others.

This approach is not only a profound way to grow spiritually, but also a hallmark of authentic Christian life. If we struggle with pride or any other sin, practicing this mindset can help us improve. It keeps us focused inward, examining our motives and striving to be more like Christ. At the same time, it teaches us to show greater compassion to those around us.

Ultimately, this is the heart of the spiritual journey and a core practice of Lent: turning away from our natural inclination to judge others harshly and making a conscious effort to be merciful toward them while holding ourselves to a higher standard. Through this reversal, we grow closer to God and better reflect His love in the world.
