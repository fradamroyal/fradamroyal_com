On a clear morning, Abraham stood upon a hillside, his eyes straining through tears toward the place he loved. Smoke rose in tragic columns, a stark reminder of devastation—of loss. Abraham, who once saved Sodom with sword and valor, could now only watch in sorrow as flames consumed it.

This moment, this heartbreaking moment, captures  the intersection of God's justice and the tender mercy sought by human hearts. Abraham did not merely mourn the destruction of buildings and land; he grieved a place deeply woven into his life story—home to his nephew Lot, land of battles won, place of divine blessing through the priest Melchizedek. His prayers to spare the city were not transactions; they were not desperate bargaining. Rather, Abraham stood humbly before the divine justice of God, pleading solely from a place of love: “Will you sweep away the innocent with the guilty?”

Abraham spoke boldly, yet humbly, like a child confident in a parent's compassion. He pleaded not because Sodom deserved mercy, but because he hoped God's love might extend even further than human righteousness. Each plea diminished in number—fifty, forty-five, thirty, down to just ten. With each appeal, God revealed more clearly his heart: even a tiny spark of goodness was enough to stay the divine wrath. Mercy, not vengeance, defined God's final word.

Yet, the tragedy of Abraham’s intercession lies not in the number for which he asked, but in the limit to which he believed God could reach. Abraham prayed down to ten righteous people, but what if he had dared to trust further? What if his prayer had been bolder, his faith deeper, asking God not simply for fairness, but for radical mercy?

Abraham loved Sodom because it was intricately woven into the tapestry of his life, his relationships, his encounters with the divine. He saw past the sin, recognizing the hidden worth beneath the layers of wickedness. We, too, hold in our hearts cities and peoples—places dear to us, relationships scarred by pain and wrong. Do we stand on our hillsides praying cautiously, setting careful conditions on our intercessions? Or do we boldly call upon the limitless mercy of God, asking him to save not only the deserving but especially those lost entirely?

"Should not the judge of all the world act with justice?" Abraham asked. Indeed, justice tempered by mercy becomes truly divine. It transforms tragedy into redemption, judgment into compassion. Abraham’s mistake—our challenge—is believing God’s mercy has limits, that justice must overpower love. But mercy without limit, that is the revelation waiting for us.

Abraham surely would weep in the face of suffering and loss, pleading for mercy where others might seek punishment. Can we embody such compassion? Can our love grow fierce enough that, like Abraham, we move God's heart to spare and to heal?

Let us be people who hold tightly to love's audacity, praying beyond cautious conditions. May we ask boldly, fearlessly: Lord, spare even the undeserving and let mercy define your name. In our prayers and hearts, let mercy reign supreme.
