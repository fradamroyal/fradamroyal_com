Prayer is essential for every Christian. It is the lifeline that connects us to God, the way we invite him into the deepest parts of our lives. When we are in need—spiritually, emotionally, or physically—prayer is where God meets us with his grace. It is in prayer that he transforms us. Because of this, we must be people of prayer.

The story of the wedding at Cana gives us a powerful example of how to pray. Mary, the mother of Jesus, shows us what it means to approach God with both simplicity and trust. When the wine runs out at the wedding, she turns to Jesus and states the need plainly: “They have no wine.” That is all. She does not embellish her request, nor does she try to persuade or plead. Mary does not worry about the outcome. She simply places the problem before Jesus.

And then Jesus seems to hesitate. He responds to her in a way that could easily be taken as a refusal: “My hour has not yet come.” But Mary does not let this deter her. She does not walk away in frustration or disappointment. Instead, she trusts. She tells the servers, “Do whatever he tells you,” and leaves the situation in Jesus’ hands. Mary’s faith is unwavering, even in the face of what might seem like a “no” from Jesus. She trusts not only in his power but also in his goodness and timing.

What happens next reveals the heart of God. Jesus acts, performing his first miracle by transforming water into wine. But notice the order: Mary’s faith precedes the miracle. Her trust in Jesus opens the door for him to work. This is a lesson for us. If God responds this way to Mary, his own mother, why should we expect him to act differently in our lives?

Prayer is not about persuading God to do what we want. It is about placing our lives, our needs, and our desires before him and trusting in his love. It is about saying, “Here is my situation, Lord,” and leaving it in his hands, just as Mary did. And just as she did, we need to trust that God’s response—whatever it may be—is for our good.

When we pray, let us pray simply. Let us speak honestly to God about what is happening in our lives and what we need. And then let us give him the space to respond, whether in silence, through circumstances, or in ways we may not immediately recognize. Whatever his answer, we continue to move forward in trust, knowing that God’s love for us is perfect and his plan for us is good.

Prayer like this transforms us. It draws us closer to God, deepens our faith, and fills our hearts with peace, even when life’s challenges remain. So, let us take Mary’s example to heart. Let us commit ourselves to lives of prayer—prayer marked by simplicity, trust, and faith. When we do, we will find that God is faithful to transform not only our circumstances but our very lives.
