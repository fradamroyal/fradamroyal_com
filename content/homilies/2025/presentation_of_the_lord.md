**N.B. This weekend was the annual Bishop's Appeal for Ministries. This homily is focused around the appeal.**

The infant Jesus is brought to the temple, and there, in the arms of Simeon, light is revealed. This child, whom Mary and Joseph humbly present, is the fulfillment of Israel’s longing, the answer to generations of prayers. “A light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel.” Christ is the light that shatters darkness, the dawn that dispels the night of sin and death. And yet, the light of Christ is not something to be observed from a distance—it is meant to be carried, shared, and spread throughout the world.

The feast of the Presentation of the Lord is not only a recognition of Christ as the true Light; it is also a call to bear that light forward. Faith is not passive. It is a flame entrusted to us, one that must be nurtured and given to others. We are called to be bearers of Christ’s light, to ensure that it reaches those who long for it.

In our own parish and community, we see many who are waiting for that light. We have children who desire to know the Lord, but they need guidance and instruction. Converts seek full union with the Church, having discovered that the fullness of truth is found here. There are even those who have never encountered the Gospel at all. Like Simeon and Anna, they wait with expectation, longing for the light to come into their lives. Through Christian Faith Formation, supported by the Bishop’s Appeal, we can ensure that this light is carried to them. Catechists, directors of religious education, and educators receive the resources they need to share the faith, to illuminate hearts and minds with the truth of Christ. Last year, nearly 500 people entered into full communion with the Church in East Tennessee. Their journey of faith was possible because someone—perhaps a priest, a catechist, or a sponsor—took up the call to share the light.

But the work of the Gospel does not stop with teaching. It also calls us to serve those in need. In our own community, there are mothers facing crisis pregnancies, families struggling to put food on the table, and individuals who have lost hope. The light of Christ must reach them as well. Catholic Charities, another ministry supported by the Bishop’s Appeal, brings that light into dark and difficult situations. Here in our parish, every Tuesday, we open our doors to their ministry, offering care and resources to pregnant women and young mothers. In doing so, we foster a culture of life, ensuring that the dignity of every person is upheld and protected.

Christ has come as a light to the nations, and we have received that light. But we must also be its stewards. The ministries supported by the Bishop’s Appeal are a means by which we carry forward the work of Christ. Through them, the lost find direction, the poor find help, and those in darkness encounter the radiance of God’s love. This is not simply a financial obligation; it is a mission, one that each of us shares.

As we reflect on the Presentation of the Lord, let us ask ourselves: How are we carrying Christ’s light? Where are we called to share it? And will we answer that call? Through our prayers, through our support, and through our generosity to the Bishop’s Appeal, may we ensure that the light of Christ continues to shine—here, in our community, and into the whole world.
