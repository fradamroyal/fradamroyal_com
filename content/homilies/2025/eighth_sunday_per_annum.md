There is something deeply unsettling about realizing we do not see as clearly as we think. Jesus’ words confront us with this reality. We assume that we understand the world, that we can judge right from wrong, that we can identify the faults in others with accuracy. And yet, Jesus tells us otherwise. He warns that sin is not just a private matter between us and God—it distorts everything, especially our vision.

Sin clouds our perception, twisting how we see ourselves, our neighbors, and even God. The more we allow sin to take root in our lives, the more our vision deteriorates. Eventually, we become blind, unable to recognize the truth. And yet, despite this blindness, we still presume to judge others. We notice every flaw, every mistake, every shortcoming in those around us while failing to acknowledge the massive distortions within ourselves.

Jesus asks, “Why do you notice the splinter in your brother’s eye, but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own?” This is not merely a rhetorical question; it is a challenge. When we focus on the faults of others, it is often a way to avoid confronting our own sins. It is easier to gossip, to criticize, to find fault in others than to engage in the difficult work of self-examination. But Jesus is clear: before we can help others, before we can offer correction, before we can guide another person, we must first remove the beam from our own eye.

This does not mean we should ignore sin in the world or in the lives of those we love. Rather, Jesus calls us to a different way of seeing—a vision purified by humility and self-awareness. When we recognize our own failings first, we approach others with greater compassion. We stop looking to blame and instead seek to understand. We stop condemning and instead offer mercy.

If we truly embraced Christ’s teaching, our first instinct would not be to judge but to examine ourselves. Instead of seeking faults in others, we would recognize our own need for transformation. This is the vision Jesus offers—a world where clarity replaces blindness, where love takes the place of condemnation, and where mercy triumphs over judgment.

The next time we are tempted to point out someone else’s failings, let us pause. Let us ask ourselves, “What are my faults? What are my sins?” And then, let us ask Christ to heal our vision so that we may see as he sees—with truth, with mercy, and with love.
